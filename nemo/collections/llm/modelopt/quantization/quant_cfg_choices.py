    Retrieve a dictionary of modelopt quantization configuration choices.

    This function checks for the availability of specific quantization configurations defined in
    the modelopt.torch.quantization (mtq) module and returns a dictionary mapping short names to
    their corresponding configurations. The function is intended to work for different modelopt
    library versions that come with variable configuration choices.

            corresponding modelopt quantization configuration objects.
