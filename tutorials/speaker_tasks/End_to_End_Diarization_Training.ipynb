    "### Speaker Diarization as a part of ASR system\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker diarization is all about figuring out who’s speaking when in an audio recording. In the world of automatic speech recognition (ASR), this becomes even more important for handling conversations with multiple speakers. Multispeaker ASR (also called speaker-attributed or multitalker ASR) uses this process to not just transcribe what’s being said, but also to label each part of the transcript with the right speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "As ASR technology continues to advance, speaker diarization is increasingly becoming part of the ASR workflow itself. Some systems now handle speaker labeling and transcription at the same time during decoding. This means you don’t just get accurate text—you're also getting insights into who said what, making it more useful for conversational analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges in Integrating Speaker Diarization and ASR\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite significant advancements, integrating speaker diarization and ASR into a unified, seamless system remains a considerable challenge. A key obstacle lies in the need for extensive high-quality, annotated audio data featuring multiple speakers. Acquiring such data is far more complex than collecting single-speaker audio or image datasets. This challenge is particularly pronounced for low-resource languages and domains like healthcare, where strict privacy regulations further constrain data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, many real-world use cases need these models to handle really long audio files—sometimes hours of conversation at a time. Training on such lengthy data is even more complicated because it’s hard to find or annotate. This creates a big gap between what’s needed and what’s available, making multispeaker ASR one of the toughest nuts to crack in the field of speech technology."

    "\n",
    "To tackle the complexities of multispeaker automatic speech recognition (ASR), we introduce [*Sortformer*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06656), a new approach that incorporates Sort-Loss and techniques to align timestamps with text tokens. Traditional approaches like permutation-invariant loss (PIL) face challenges when applied in batchable and differentiable computational graphs, especially since token-based objectives struggle to incorporate speaker-specific attributes into PIL-based loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we propose an arrival time sorting (ATS) approach. In this method, speaker tokens from ASR outputs and speaker timestamps from diarization outputs are sorted by their arrival times to resolve permutations. This approach allows the multispeaker ASR system to be trained or fine-tuned using token-based cross-entropy loss, eliminating the need for timestamp-based or frame-level objectives with PIL."

Additionally, during the multispeaker ASR training phase, no specialized loss calculation functions are needed when using Sortformer, as frameworks for standard single-speaker ASR models can be employed. These compatibilities greatly simplify and accelerate the training and fine-tuning process of multispeaker ASR systems. \n",
